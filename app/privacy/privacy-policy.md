Privacy Policy

Effective Date: November 5th 2024

Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy outlines how our app collects, uses, and protects your data in accordance with Google’s policies and requirements. By using this app, you agree to the terms of this policy.

1. Data Collection and Use
   This app uses Google OAuth to allow users to sign in with their Google accounts and access their Google Calendar events. Upon authorization, the app fetches your Google Calendar events to display them alongside relevant weather data in a custom user interface.

Temporary Data Storage: The app does not store any of your data on external servers or databases. All fetched calendar data is stored locally in your browser's memory, which is erased once you close the app.
Scope of Access: The app only requests permissions necessary to display your calendar events and to enable you to create, edit, and delete events in your own Google Calendar. We do not access any other personal information.

2. No Data Retention
   Your calendar data is only accessed when you are actively using the app. Upon closing the app or signing out, all calendar data is deleted from the browser memory and is only accessible through your Google Calendar or by signing into the app. The app does not retain any user data. after your session ends.

3. Data Security
   We prioritize your data security and use Google’s OAuth 2.0 for authentication, which provides a secure sign-in experience without compromising your credentials. By limiting data storage to your browser’s local memory, we aim to minimize any security risks associated with external data storage.

4. Data Sharing
   We do not share, sell, or transfer your information to any third parties. The app only accesses your Google Calendar data to display and manage events within your account, and it does not store or transmit any data outside of your session.

5. Changes to This Policy
   We may update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in our practices or legal requirements. When we make changes, the "Effective Date" at the top will be updated accordingly.
