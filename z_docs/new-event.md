| end                | nested object | The (exclusive) end time of the event. For a recurring event, this is the end time of the first instance.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| end.date           | date          | The date, in the format "yyyy-mm-dd", if this is an all-day event. writable                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| end.dateTime       | datetime      | The time, as a combined date-time value (formatted according to RFC3339). A time zone offset is required unless a time zone is explicitly specified in timeZone. writable                                                                                                                                                                    |
| end.timeZone       | string        | The time zone in which the time is specified. (Formatted as an IANA Time Zone Database name, e.g. "Europe/Zurich".) For recurring events this field is required and specifies the time zone in which the recurrence is expanded. For single events this field is optional and indicates a custom time zone for the event start/end. writable |
| endTimeUnspecified | boolean       | Whether the end time is actually unspecified. An end time is still provided for compatibility reasons, even if this attribute is set to True. The default is False.                                                                                                                                                                          |
